        <p class="about">VTU SGPA and CGPA calculator is a tool designed to easily calculate sgpa and cgpa. All you need to do is enter 
            your marks that you have got for the semester you want to calculate when it comes to SGPA. I will try to add more
            features and keep this site updated. If this website has helped you, consider recommending it to your friends.

            The story of how this page was created is simple: when I went to class one morning after VTU had released the results, the 
            guy sitting behind me was complaining that he could not calculate his GPA as he did not know how the 
            calculation was done. He said the credits varied from subject to subject. He also proudly stated he was too lazy to do it.
            He complained through the entire class. I made this site to stop him from complaining.
